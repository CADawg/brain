#Blog #Dev 
I found [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev) recently, which is a small, JavaScript and style sheet free website (with inline styles of course). It feels like my style of blogging as I've always hated how bloated WordPress is even for the most basic of websites. Today, I decided to publish my first blog post about [Email to WebMail URL API](../../Projects/Email%20to%20WebMail%20URL%20API.md) which is intended to make user email verification easier and I may implement it inside [ConfigDN](https://configdn.com) Soon.
