[JSR](https://jsr.io)  is NPM but built for TypeScript, requiring no extra steps to transpile the code as it is all handled for you. I don't know how easy it is as I haven't tried it yet, but knowing how much of a faff converting a typescript project to JavaScript with typescript support has always been a bane of mine, I am looking forward to this. It looks like you just upload typescript source and then it converts it to .d.ts files + .js files so that anyone can use it and it also says it works across JavaScript runtimes.
